## Project Description

This was a simple project to practice using Leaflet to visualize data, and using Github Pages to publish the visualization online. Data was taken from a json file ([Citi Bike Information endpoint](https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json)) and then a javascript file was written, which plotted each Citi Bike station as a marker on a map of New York City. When a marker is clicked, the webpage shows the name of the station followed by the capacity of that Citi Bike station. This was then all published to https://jonnybrammah.github.io/citibike-visualization/
Screenshots of the visualizations of this data are shown below.

## Visualizations
